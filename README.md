<h4>Author : Andoni ALONSO TORT</h4>

### Angular + TypeScript

Implementing authentication in Angular with JWT received from server.

A front-end application built with Angular, designed to provide an intuitive and modern interface for user and role management. It includes:

- ‚úÖ An intuitive user interface for login and user profile management.
- ‚úÖ Role management with specific views and permissions based on user authorizations.
- ‚úÖ Integration with a secure REST API, developed in Node.js, for all authentication and user management operations. Communications use JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure secure exchanges.
- ‚úÖ Support for conditional navigation with protected routes based on user login status and roles.
- ‚úÖ An optimized user experience thanks to modern libraries like Angular Router and HttpClient, HTTP INTERCEPTORS, etc.

This front-end is designed to interact with the [authentication JWT Node.js back-end proejct](https://github.com/AndoniAT/Auth_JWT_NodeJs). Offering a solid and secure foundation for applications requiring advanced user management.

## Angular Project Details

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.6.

#### Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

#### Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

#### Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

#### Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

#### Additional Resources

For more information on using the Angular CLI, including detailed command references, visit the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.

  </tr>
</table>

## == üè† Home Page ==

On the homepage, there will be a page similar to when starting a new project with Angular, except that there will be an additional navbar with navigation buttons.
<div style="flex inline-flex">
     <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e2d9b35-b319-4779-985b-73d573973338" width="500"/>

</div>

## == üîê Login ==

Login page to connect to the application. This form calls the login API of the back-end project, which provides an accessToken with a duration of 1 minute and also stores a refreshToken in the cookies.

Each time an API call fails because the token has expired, the application will automatically request a new accessToken. The backend will use the refreshToken stored in the cookies to verify if the user is authorized to make this request.
